# Employee-Quality-Predictor-Big-5-
An Employee Quality Predictor classifies employees to personalities based on traits that best fits the job requirements. I will be using a dataset of 1,015,342 questionnaire answers collected online by Open Psychometrics. I will be using an unsupervised learning algorithm called K-means to cluster the dataset into career labels like Project Manager, Software Engineer, Human Resource Specialist and so, on. The career labels are going to be based on the Big 5 factors: Extroversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability/Neuroticism and Openness. The rise of mental health and stability at work are crucial to most competitive companies. Using these factors as indicators of their positive and negative traits would enormously modify the environment and efficiency of the workplace.
